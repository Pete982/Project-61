            My Hobby is Drawing and I like to draw what's on my mind sometimes. I used to draw on my homework (I drew on the side of the page that didn't have the writing on it.) I love to draw because it helps me express myself and more!

        <p> Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960)[2] is an American business executive who has been the chief executive officer of Apple Inc. since 2011. Cook previously served as the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs.[3]

            Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then served as the executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations.[4] He was made the chief executive on August 24, 2011, prior to Jobs' death in October of that year.[5] During his tenure as the chief executive, he has advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion.[6]

            In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.[7] Cook also serves on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc.[5] and the National Football Foundation,[8] and is a trustee of Duke University.[9] Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy, and in March 2015, he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.[10]
